                    <p>codedamn (codedamn, we or us) is committed to protecting your privacy. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information about you or associated with you (“personal information”), and your choices about the collection and use of your information. This Privacy Policy applies to the online services offered by codedamn at codedamn.com.</p>
                    <p>For the purposes of EU data protection laws (&quot;Data Protection Law&quot;), codedamn is data controller (i.e., the company who is responsible for, and controls the processing of, your personal data).</p>
                    <p>We collect the following types of information about you:</p>

                    <p>Account information: You can browse our site without providing personal information, but you must register in order to access most of the features of Service. We ask for certain information such as your username, email address and password when you create a codedamn account, or if you correspond with us.</p>
                    <p>Data collected through the use of the Service: After you set up your account, codedamn members may also choose to provide additional information which may be shared through public profiles, such as your name, location, website, links to your social media profiles, and other information. You control how much personally identifying information you wish to provide in your public profile.</p>
                    <p>Messages and User Content: We may retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service such as comments.</p>
                    <p>We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, as well as to communicate directly with you, such as to send you email messages. You can control your receipt of email messages by visiting Settings within your Dashboard once you&#x27;re logged in. We may also send you Service-related emails (e.g. account verification, change or updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt-out of Service-related e-mails. For more information about your communication preferences, see “Your Choices Regarding Your Information” below.</p>
                    <h2>INFORMATION WE MAY RECEIVE FROM SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES</h2>

This information could include the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. If you allow us access to your friends list, your friends’ user IDs, and your connection to those friends, may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our Service as well as provide you with updates if and when your friends join codedamn.
