Hello everyone, my name is [Your Name], and 
I'm thrilled to be here today 
to introduce you to the exciting world of cloud computing and Amazon Web Services, 
commonly known as AWS. 

Joining me today is my good friend and AWS expert, Aditya. 
[Aditya's Name] is a seasoned cloud solutions architect with a strong background in implementing AWS services
He brings a wealth of practical experience to our presentation, 
and I'm excited to have him share his insights with all of you.

Before we dive into the nuts and bolts of AWS, 
let's take a quick look at what we'll be covering in this presentation:


Cloud computing is a way of using the internet to access and store data or run programs,
which makes it easier to manage and also to access the information from anywhere.

Mainly there are three diferent clouds 
public
private and hybrid

and also coming to major services of cloud are proiding servers, databases,applications and many more


It is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon 
and major features of aws are 


AWS S3 is a file storage service which can  store and retrie any type of files from anywhere 

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service which lets you run your code without managing servers, 
and also it automatically gets scaled to handle requests in real-time.


aws step function is famous for its "synchronize workflow" 
which means it helps in coordinating and managing the execution of multiple tasks 
in a well-defined order, 
and also it ensures that 
each step is completed before proceeding to the next one. 
It helps create efficient and reliable workflows between different components of a system.


Structured data is organized and formatted, 
typically which is in stored in tabular format with will have defined columns and properties, 
making it easily searchable 

and on the other hand Unstructured data lacks a predefined structure 
and is typically found in formats like text, images, audio, or video, 
which makes it more challenging 



SQL databases are relational databases that use structured tables with fixed schemas and defined properties 
NoSQL databases, on the other hand, 
which are non-relational databases 
that offer flexible schema options
for handling unstructured or semi-structured data.

api gateway securely connect you to to the backend services like suppose take a scenario 
where application has signup page and login page 
which reuqires three different lambdas 
where one lambda to analyze inputs from login page and aunthenticate 
and another to store the text data in database from signup page
and another lambda which stores the profile image in the s3

its collects and monitos the metrics or logs from our services
which later helps us to analyze if any operational errors happens 


Now, I'll hand over the stage to aditya, 
who will take us through the next section of presentation.
